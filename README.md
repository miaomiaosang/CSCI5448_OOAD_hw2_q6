Yu Li's python code for hw2 q6

running result

The shape list database contains 5 shapes.

Square displayed, z index = 1, location x: 10, y: -4

Circle displayed, z index = 3, location x: 4, y: 5

Triangle displayed, z index = 5, location x: -7, y: 3

Square displayed, z index = 7, location x: 15, y: 1

Circle displayed, z index = 10, location x: 6, y: 3

The class shape contains a variable called order. This variable is used to sort the shape. The class shape also contains variables x and y, which are used to indicate the location of shape displaying.

In the main class(main.py, the controlling program), I initiated a shape database manually

The sort_2 class is used to sort the list("shape database"). 

Thank you for checking!
